# Data Analysis Projects
A collection of data analysis projects I've done. There are three main folders as listed below:

## Clustering Orlando Neighborhoods Based on Covid Cases
This project was used as a capstone for the IBM Data Science certificate.  In this project I used the Foursquare API to cluster Orlando neighborhoods into 5 clusters using the elbow method.  

A heat map was then used to to showcase the number of Covid-19 cases in each Orlando neighborhood.  The clusters were grouped along with the heat map.  

The analysis determined that there was a high correlation in the clusters created and their corresponding Covid-19 cases.

## Determining Stock Growth Leading up to Quarterly Earnings
This project's aim was to determine if recent trends in stock the stock market could be used to determine if a stock would increase in price leading up to its quarterly earnings.

A list of all publicly traded stocks in the USA was created and then features were created based on technical indicators and other categories such as the stock's sector. Using a KNN model, it was found that a stock's price leading up to quarterly earnings could only be predicted by abou 60%. The analysis might be improved by using more features or a longer trend as only the most recent 90 days were used.

## Projects from the Web
This is a collection of projects I obtained from Janatahack.com.  I supply these to showcase my usage of a variety of ML and Regression techniques.
