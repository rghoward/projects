# Projects
This repository is a collection of projects I wish to share.

## Data Analysis Projects
This folder contains a group of projects I have done where I have went through one iteration of a data analysis cycle.  It contains two major projects: 
1. Clustering Orlando Neighborhoods Based on Covid Cases
2. Determining Stock Growth Leading up to Quarterly Earnings

It also contains a selection of projects where I showcased my use of a variety of ML techniques.

##DB_Project
This folder contains a project that saw a database created from start to finish.  Vue.js was used to display queries and Python was used to make those queries.  The database was created in PostgreSQL.
